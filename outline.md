Hi there,

Introducing this talk.

The purpose behind this brown bag is to give an understanding of how git
works, so you can come to it with a fresh eye if you've been working
with SVN, or any other source control systems.

In this talk, 

 * we'll create a repo, 
 * make a few commits, 
 * branch and merge back in, 
 * making remotes and pushing changes

Explaining what's happening along the way.


Git is distributed, fast, built on surprisingly simple fundamentals.
